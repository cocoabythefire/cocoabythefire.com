  %h1 My Story
  %img{ src: image_path("me.jpg"), alt: "Personal Photo" }
  %p It all started in Cincinnati. A land of amazing ice cream, epic riverfront fireworks, chili cheese coneys, great sports teams, and genuinely nice people. I moved to Chicago in 2004 to attend engineering school at Northwestern University, and so far I haven't left. That's where I met my insanely amazing husband whose name rhymes with mine (I know - you don't have to say it). We have the world's best dog, a black and white Havanese named Milo.
  %p These days, I enjoy traveling, cooking, eating food that involves chocolate (extra dark), reading, writing, cuddling, and occasionally painting. That list changes though. Whenever people ask me whether I am a morning or night person I say neither because I hate waking up and I go to bed earlier than pretty much all of my friends. I don't own a car, don't like being in them, and generally hate to drive. Walking clears my head and biking or public transit are more efficient in the city. My idea of a good time is sharing yummy food and drinks with great people. Oh, and I take my hot cocoa fireside with homemade whipped cream AND marshmallows thank you very much!

  %p So, sometimes I paint. Oil painting in a modern/abstract style to be precise. I find it soothing and energizing at the same time. I also build my own canvases (and by "I" what I really mean is "my husband" because I cannot work a staple gun to save my life). Anyway, here are a few works that I have completed...
