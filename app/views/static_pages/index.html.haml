  %h1 About Me
  %img{ src: image_path("me.jpg"), alt: "Personal Photo" }
  %p
    For as long as I can remember I have marveled at the power of technology to improve, transform, and delight the world. I'm passionate about tackling everyday personal or business challenges by building and shipping intelligently designed, functional software. From 2009 to 2013 I co-founded and managed
    %a{ href: "http://www.fadingred.com/" }
      FadingRed
    , a small, independent development shop in Chicago. At FadingRed, I had the opportunity to lead many Mac, iPhone, iPad, and web app development projects for corporate and startup clients. However our modest beginnings were as a consumer products company, building and shipping award winning Mac and iOS apps to the App Stores: 
    %a{ href: "http://www.kokuapp.com/" }
      Koku 
    and 
    %a{ href: "http://www.senutiapp.com/" }
      Senuti
    ='.'

  %p With 7+ years of experience leading agile, creative software teams to build and ship award winning software, both direct to consumer and as b2b solutions, I've racked up a wealth of technical product management expertise. I've also had the opportunity to work in a variety of environments from my own startup to major global brands including: Proctor & Gamble, IBM, and most recently, New Relic.

  %h1 Outreach
  %p
    Despite the rise in young women and minorities pursuing STEM related fields, the number pursuing computer science degrees actually decreased by 64% from 2000 to 2011<sup>1</sup>. Approximately 26% of professional computer related jobs are currently held by women, and less than 3% by minority women<sup>1</sup>. Those facts bother me. But those are really just numbers. As a woman in the field, I'll tell you the real reason this matters to me: we should not be letting men have all the fun!

  %p
    With so many amazing computer related jobs and many more being created all the time, I want to see conferences and events full of diverse people ready to get their hands dirty. The status quo today, unfortunately, is that the female/minority representation at professional computer related events is frequently considerably less than 26%. Through encouragement, mentorship, role models, and spreading the word, I know this will change.</br>
