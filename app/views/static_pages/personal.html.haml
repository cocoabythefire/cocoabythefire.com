  %h1 My Story

  %p It all started in Cincinnati. A land of amazing ice cream, epic riverfront fireworks, chili cheese coneys, great sports teams, and genuinely nice people. I moved to Chicago in 2004 to attend engineering school at Northwestern University, and ended up staying for nearly a decade.
  %p These days, you can find me in Portland, Oregon where I live with my amazing husband and fluffy Havanese. I enjoy exploring the outdoors, traveling, cooking, eating chocolate (extra dark), reading, writing, and occasionally painting. That list changes though. Whenever people ask me whether I am a morning or night person I have to say neither because I hate waking up and I go to bed earlier than all my friends. Oh, and most importantly, I take my hot cocoa fireside with whipped cream AND marshmallows!

  %p So, sometimes I paint. Oil painting in a modern/abstract style to be precise. I find it soothing and energizing at the same time. I also build my own canvases (and by "I" what I really mean is "my husband" because I am not a fan of staple guns). Anyway, here are a few works that I have completed...
